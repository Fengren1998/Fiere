# Fiere
An RPG Companion for all game masters and solo players.

As of version 0.12b, there is no UI.

As of version 0.12c, the prophecy system has been temporarily retracted. The code is still there of course.

To-do List (self-reminder):
1. Full UI
2. Card Organizer, where a user may create cards then classify them into custom genres. It'll also be possible to randomly draw a card. Needs a full UI.
3. Revamp of Name Generation
4. Revamp of the Prophecy System
5. Add Mythic's Location Crafter
6. Modify the way Fate is done
7. Refine some features like events and perhaps details
8. Check and see which features are useless (to remove the features)
9. Clean the fucking code
